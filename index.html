<P>Git is a distributed version control system widely used for tracking changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to collaborate on projects efficiently by providing features such as branching, merging, and conflict resolution. Each developer can work on their own copy of the codebase, known as a repository, and then merge their changes with others' seamlessly. Git's decentralized nature ensures that even if a central server goes down, developers can continue working with their local repositories. Additionally, Git provides a robust set of tools for managing code history, including reverting to previous versions and inspecting changes over time. Overall, Git is an essential tool for modern software development workflows, enabling teams to work together effectively and manage complex projects with ease.</P>
